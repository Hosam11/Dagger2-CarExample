     * By annotating a non-private, non-final member variable with @Inject, we tell Dagger to set

     * Field injection is mainly used to inject variables into Android framework types that the
     * system instantiates and on which we canâ€™t do constructor injection, like activities,
     * BroadcastReceivers and fragments.
     *
     * To trigger the injection process on an already instantiated object (like an activity),
     * we have to create and call a members-injection method in our component that takes this
     * particular class as an argument.

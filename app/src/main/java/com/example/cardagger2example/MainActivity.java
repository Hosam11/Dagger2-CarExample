/* About generated classes
-> @Provide method always has to be executed because the annotation process doesn't know what happened
   in the method body it doesn't know that we just want to return the implementation for interface
-> but @Bind method are abstract so dagger knows there is no method body nothing
to execute and it just call the constructor directly

-> dagger creates _Factory for each @Inject constructor and _Provide#ClassNameFactory for
    each @Provides method
-> there is no factory created for @Bind  methods because dagger doesn't have to call code for it and it just
   directly call the constructor instead
-> Factory classes knows how to created corresponding object
->Provider<> is the wrapper object that know how to created instance of the object they are wrapped

     * By annotating a non-private, non-final member variable with @Inject, we tell Dagger to set

     * Field injection is mainly used to inject variables into Android framework types that the
     * system instantiates and on which we canâ€™t do constructor injection, like activities,
     * BroadcastReceivers and fragments.
     * <p>
     * To trigger the injection process on an already instantiated object (like an activity),
     * we have to create and call a members-injection method in our component that takes this
     * particular class as an argument.
